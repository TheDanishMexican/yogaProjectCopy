                        Private sessions are one-on-one classes or small group
                        classes offering the opportunity to create custom
                        tailored sessions adapted to your specific needs.
                        Whether you are a beginner or a more experienced yogi,
                        private sessions are a great way to deepen your
                        practice, establish a greater connection to your body,
                        and expand your knowledge of yoga.
                        <br /> <br /> Private yoga is a fantastic and effective
                        way to open and heal your body emotionally and/or
                        physically. It is a great way to build strength and
                        connection with your body, mind, and spirit. <br />{' '}

                    <h4>HOW IT WORKS</h4> <br />
                    <p>
                        Sessions whether one-on-one, smaller groups, or
                        corporate settings, are held in my at-home yoga room, in
                        the comfort of your home or any other private setting of
                        your choosing.
                        <br /> <br />
                        On one-on-one yoga sessions with me, the main focus is
                        on the fundamentals of yoga. Whether you are at the very
                        beginning of your yoga journey or have been practicing
                        for some time, our sessions are all about meeting you
                        exactly where you are. It is a great way to either dig
                        deeper or start your practice. <br /> <br /> We will, in
                        a safe, meaningful, and strong manner focus on essential
                        yoga techniques for yoga poses, breath, and meditation.
                        Essentially creating a sustainable yoga practice that
                        you will want to keep growing and exploring, just as
                        much on your own.

                        first meeting. A first practice will also happen on this
